## Project Title: Student Exam Performance Indicator using Supervised Machine Learning

# Description:
Developed a predictive model leveraging supervised machine learning techniques to forecast math scores based on various student parameters. Utilized features such as reading score, writing score, gender, lunch type,parental level of education and test preparation course as inputs for the model.

# Key Contributions:

1. Explored and preprocessed diverse student data, incorporating reading score, writing score, gender, parental level of education,lunch type, and test preparation course as features.
2. Employed a supervised machine learning algorithm (linear regression) to train and create the predictive model.
3. Optimized model performance through feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation techniques.
4. Evaluated model accuracy and fine-tuned algorithms to achieve a robust prediction of math scores.
5. Demonstrated the model's efficacy in predicting student performance, contributing insights into the influence of various factors on math scores.

# Outcome:
Successfully developed a reliable Student Exam Performance Indicator that accurately predicts math scores based on a combination of student-related variables. The project showcased the potential of supervised machine learning in forecasting academic performance and provided valuable insights for educational strategies.
